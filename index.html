		<h2>Hi there,</h2>
		<p>
            You have stumbled upon yet another personal website and this one belongs to Subhadeep Bhattacharyya, a Software Engineer currenltly pursuing his 
            Master's in <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Information Systems Management<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>from Carnegie Mellon University.
            Subhadeep got accustomed to the delusional world of computers at the tender age of 10. Under peer pressure he started playing <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/198437-recoil/reviews/124648" target="_blank">Recoil<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and the rest of his gaming career is history. Relevantly, he started coding in <a href="https://www.bluej.org" target="_blank">Blue J</a> later around 12 and has been passionate about programming and technology since. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            In High School, Subhadeep lost track of his passion and started venturing into sports. With a knack for outdoor sports, he developed an affinity for Cricket and Soccer. The irreversable damage caused by the deplorable obsession made him realize the similarities between a sportsman and an engineer. Both need to have the right training, in-depth field knowledge and undying enthusiasm to finish what they started. This influenced Subhadeep to take up Computer Science and Engineering at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, while pursuing with his habbit for finishing Cricket matches. While in college, Subhadeep realized his true love for softwares while spending endless hours with his laptop and an IDE. The journey to reach the pinnacle of software engineering has been ongoing ever since. 
         </p>
         <p>   
            In the recent months, Subhadeep has worked primarily on novel technologies and future-of-work including Cloud Computing, No SQL Databases, Big Data Technologies, Internet Of Things, Distributed Systems, Data Mining, Business Intelligence and Digital Transformation. Apart from academics Subhadeep also loves absorbing knowledge about sports, cars, bars, eateries, painting, astronomy and books. He is an enthusiast and a generalist who strongly believes that softwares are more than "Lines of Code".  
		</p>
		<h3>Origin</h3>
		<p>
	     Subhadeep comes from the serene valleys of Tripura, located in the North-Eastern part of India. He spent his childhood amidst a "scene straight out of Switzerland" and has deep inclination towards nature. He considers himself lucky to have been brought up in such an atmosphere and tries to re-juvenate his bond with mother nature once in a while. These days, you can find him in and around Heinz College, mostly running after his assignments.		
		</p>
		<h3>Professional Experiences</h3>
		<p>
	     Subhadeep started his professional endeavor with Tata Consultancy Services, Research and Development wing as a Full Stack Software Engineer. He later moved on to work as a Software Engineer and later as an IT Analyst for one of the largest telecommunication clients of the company, alternating between Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Mumbai, India. During these years, he primarily worked on Siebel CRM 8.0, Oracle 12g, Unix Shell Scripting and client-side deployments. Working with multi-cultural teams, he has also developed a knack for understanding Arabic and nitty-gritty's of client interaction. He has thoroughly enjoyed his client-site experience and aims to work in client-facing roles in the future.	
	     After four and a half fruitful years at the organization, Subhadeep has returned to school to pursue his life-long dream of reaching the pinnacle of Software Engineering. Having extensively worked on Customer Relationship Management(CRM), he understands the business aspect of Software Engineering and aims to topple it with his recently gained knowledge of Cloud Computing, Big Data Technologies and Data Mining. In the near future he would love to work with cloud and big data technologies specializing in Customer Relationship Management domain. 
		</p>
		<h3>Life After Work</h3>
		<p>
         Other than work, Subhadeep is a moderately skilled singer, an amateur painter, a numismatist and a voracious reader. While outdoors, he can mostly be found playing volleyball, soccer or kayaking around the Monongahela.
